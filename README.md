LegislatureSQL
==============

Project to set up interchange software between the JSON data provided by the OpenStates project and an SQL database, in this case MySQL.

Well, first, I am going to add the code I use to read the CA legislative information out of the state web site and the code that I use to
generate data in MySQL tables to store information from the HTML files that are put out by the legilative.

The OpenStates project uses the MySQL database exported by the CA LAO. I think there are problems with that database. They do not expose
all of it (as far as I can tell) and the HTML files actually give a more easily parsable version of the data. Their database contains
some very odd XML that seems to come from SharePoint. I think the OpenStates just ignores this data. This allows them to get to the
simple data easily, but does not expose the whole story.

I think I may be able to use the HTML files to put data into a MySQL database and I think that I can product, from that, JSON data which
may be more complete than the data that the OpenStates processing comes up with. We will see.

For now, I am not worrying about how documented this is. Mostly I want to not lose this code again.

Note: The script relies on a file in your home directory, named .leg_sql_options.txt, which contains:

    db <name of your MySQL database>
    user <username for your MySQL user>
    pwd <password for your MySQL user>
    session <default session, eg 11-12 or 13-14>
